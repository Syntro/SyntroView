# SyntroView

SyntroView is Qt GUI application for viewing remote SyntroCam feeds.


### Dependencies

1. Qt4 or Qt5 development libraries and headers
2. SyntroCore libraries and headers 


### Fetch

        git clone git://github.com/Pansenti/SyntroView.git


### Build 

        qmake 
        make 
        sudo make install

### Run

The executable file is called SyntroView and can be run from the
command line like this

        SyntroView

With some camera feeds you may see errors like this

		Corrupt JPEG data: 2 extraneous bytes before marker 0xd4
		Corrupt JPEG data: 1 extraneous bytes before marker 0xd5
		Corrupt JPEG data: 5 extraneous bytes before marker 0xd5
		Corrupt JPEG data: 3 extraneous bytes before marker 0xd4
		Corrupt JPEG data: 1 extraneous bytes before marker 0xd5
		Corrupt JPEG data: 5 extraneous bytes before marker 0xd1
		Corrupt JPEG data: 2 extraneous bytes before marker 0xd1
		Corrupt JPEG data: 2 extraneous bytes before marker 0xd5

        
Those are coming from Qt's built-in libjpeg. It is complaining about some
bad JPEG images generated by web cameras. The errors are harmless but there
is no easy way to turn them off without rebuilding libjpeg. They can be
ignored and discarded by running SyntroView this way

        SyntroView &> /dev/null &

The errors are generated during the uncompression of the JPEG images when
displaying and do not affect console or daemon mode operations.


### Configuration

SyntroView writes a configuration file to the local directory where
it was invoked, so if you run it from your home directory like this

        ~$ SymotesView &

Then you will get a file called ~/SymotesView.ini created.
